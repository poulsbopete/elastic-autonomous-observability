    ## Lab 3 — Inject a Fault and Watch Elastic Detect It

    **By the end of this challenge you will:**

    - ✅ Trigger a realistic fault using the Demo App Chaos controller
    - ✅ Watch the error spike appear in Elastic's log stream within seconds
    - ✅ See an ES|QL alert rule fire within 30–60 seconds
    - ✅ Observe the AI agent begin its investigation automatically

    **You have 20 fault channels to choose from** — each simulates a realistic incident across AWS, GCP, and Azure services. Pick any one and watch Elastic light up.

    ## How Fault Detection Works

    Every fault channel is monitored by a dedicated **ES|QL alert rule** running on a 30-second schedule:

    ```
    FROM logs*
    | WHERE @timestamp > NOW() - 2 MINUTES
    | WHERE body.text : "MacAddressFlappingException"
    | STATS error_count = COUNT(*)
    | WHERE error_count > 5
    ```

    When errors exceed the threshold:
    1. The alert fires and appears in **Observability → Alerts**
    2. The alert triggers the **Significant Event Notification** workflow
    3. The workflow calls the **AI agent** with the error context
    4. The agent queries logs, correlates signals, and produces a root-cause analysis

    ## Fault Cascade: Why Observability Is Hard

    A single fault channel doesn't just affect one service — it cascades:

    | Step | What happens |
    |------|-------------|
    | **1** | Primary service emits `ERROR` logs with a specific exception type |
    | **2** | Downstream services emit `WARN` — degraded upstream responses |
    | **3** | Trace spans show elevated latency at integration boundaries |
    | **4** | Host metrics spike on the affected cloud provider |

    This cascade across logs, metrics, and traces is what makes incidents hard to diagnose manually — and what makes Elastic's correlated view so powerful.

    ## 20 Fault Channels — Pick One

    | Category | Cloud | Example Faults |
    |----------|-------|---------------|
    | **Network Core** | Azure | MAC flapping, BGP peer drop, spanning tree change |
    | **Security** | Azure | Firewall session exhaustion, SSL cert expiry |
    | **WiFi / Network Access** | GCP | AP disconnect storm, channel interference |
    | **Network Services** | Azure | DNS failure, DHCP lease storm |
    | **Commerce** | AWS | Bid latency spike, payment timeout, catalog sync failure |
    | **Manufacturing** | AWS | Print queue overflow, QC rejection spike |
    | **Logistics** | GCP | Label printer failure, warehouse scanner desync |
    | **Cloud Ops** | GCP | Orphaned resource alert, VPN tunnel flapping |

    Start with **Channel 12 — Auction Bid Latency Spike** for the clearest end-to-end demo.

# Inject a Fault and Watch Elastic Detect It

Trigger a fault from the **Demo App**, then watch Elastic automatically investigate and create a case — no human intervention required.

---

## Step 1 — Inject a Fault

1. Open the **Chaos Controller** tab
2. Select any fault channel and click **Inject Fault**

> **Recommended:** Start with **Channel 12 — Auction Bid Latency Spike** for the clearest end-to-end demo.

While the fault propagates, run this query in **Elastic Serverless → Discover → ES|QL** to watch the error spike in real time:

```esql
FROM logs*
| WHERE @timestamp > NOW() - 15 MINUTES
| WHERE severity_text == "ERROR"
| STATS errors = COUNT(*) BY service.name
| SORT errors DESC
```

> **Tip:** Re-run this every 30 seconds after injecting the fault — you'll see the affected service's error count climb while all other services stay flat.

---

## Step 2 — Watch the Workflow Run

In the **Elastic Serverless** tab, go to **Observability → Workflows**.

Within 1–2 minutes of injecting the fault, the **Fanatics Collectibles Significant Event Notification** workflow will show a recent execution. Click it to see each step:

- **count_errors** — ES|QL query counting recent errors from the affected service
- **run_rca** — AI agent root-cause analysis
- **create_case** — Kibana case created with RCA findings

Click **View Full Conversation** to open the AI agent's complete chat thread — you can see exactly what it queried, what it found, and why it drew its conclusions. You can even type follow-up questions or ask the agent to take a remediation action.

---

## Step 3 — Review the Case

Go to **Observability → Cases** (or click **Cases** in the left nav).

A new case will appear automatically with:
- The fault name and affected service in the title
- The AI agent's root-cause analysis in the description
- Severity set to **High**

✅ **Ready to continue when** you can see a workflow execution and an auto-created case in Elastic Serverless.
