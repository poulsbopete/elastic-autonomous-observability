    ## Lab 1 — Connect to Elastic Cloud & Deploy

    **What's happening right now:**
    Your Elastic Cloud Serverless Observability project is being provisioned and the Fanatics Live demo platform is being configured with your credentials.

    **By the end of this challenge you will:**

    - ✅ Confirm the Fanatics Live scenario is deployed and sending telemetry
    - ✅ Open your Elastic Serverless project — no login required
    - ✅ Verify logs, metrics, and traces are flowing from 9 microservices
    - ✅ Review the auto-provisioned AI agent, alert rules, and workflows

    *Setup takes 3–4 minutes. Grab a coffee — it'll be ready soon.*

    ## Your Lab Environment

    **Two tabs, everything you need:**

    | Tab | What it is |
    |-----|-----------|
    | **Demo App** | Control panel — view service health, manage deployments, inject faults |
    | **Elastic Serverless** | Your Observability project — pre-logged in, data already flowing |

    **The Fanatics Live scenario simulates 9 microservices across 3 clouds:**

    - ☁️ **AWS** — Auction Engine, Card Printing, Payment Processing
    - ☁️ **GCP** — Fan Engagement, Loyalty Rewards, Streaming CDN
    - ☁️ **Azure** — Navigation, Fraud Detection, Fulfillment

    Every service emits **real OpenTelemetry** logs, metrics, and traces — no synthetic data.

    ## What Was Auto-Deployed

    When the lab started, the setup script provisioned your full observability stack automatically:

    | Resource | Details |
    |----------|---------|
    | **Alert rules** | 20 ES\|QL rules — one per fault channel, 30s interval |
    | **AI agent** | Investigation tools + system prompt |
    | **Workflows** | Alert → investigate → create case → remediate |
    | **Dashboards** | Executive dashboard + OTel signal dashboards |
    | **Data views** | `logs.otel`, `metrics-*`, `traces-*` |

    This is the same stack you'd deploy in production — configured in code, repeatable, version-controlled.

    ## Key Concepts: Elastic Serverless + OpenTelemetry

    **Elastic Serverless** scales compute and storage independently. No cluster management, no shard tuning — just ingest and query.

    **OpenTelemetry (OTel)** is the CNCF standard for vendor-neutral instrumentation. Elastic is a Platinum member and natively ingests OTLP — no Collector required.

    **ES|QL** is Elastic's pipe-based query language, purpose-built for telemetry at scale:

    ```
    FROM logs*
    | WHERE severity_text == "ERROR"
    | STATS errors = COUNT(*) BY service.name
    | SORT errors DESC
    ```

    **AI Workflows** connect alert detection to investigation to remediation — all without human intervention.

    Setup takes a few minutes. Survive the anomaly storm while Elastic provisions your environment:

# Connect to Elastic Cloud & Deploy

Everything was **automatically provisioned** when this lab started — your Elastic Cloud project is live, 9 microservices are sending telemetry, and the AI observability stack is configured. Nothing to set up.

---

## Explore the Demo App

Use the three Demo App tabs to explore the running scenario:

| Tab | What you'll see |
|-----|----------------|
| **Demo App** | Scenario selector — overview and deployment status |
| **Live Dashboard** | Real-time service health across all 9 microservices |
| **Chaos Controller** | 20 fault channels ready to inject — you'll use this in Lab 3 |

---

## Explore Elastic Serverless

Click the **Elastic Serverless** tab — you're already logged in. Navigate to:

- **Discover → ES|QL** — query live logs from `auction-engine`, `card-printing-system`, `digital-marketplace`, and more
- **Applications → Service inventory** — distributed traces from 7 services
- **Observability → Infrastructure** — 3 simulated hosts (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- **Observability → SLOs** — 21 auto-created SLOs, one per service per signal type
- **Observability → Workflows** — 4 pre-configured AI response workflows

> **Tip:** Set the time range to **Last 15 minutes** to see the freshest data.

## What Was Auto-Deployed

| Resource | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Alert rules | 20 ES\|QL rules — one per fault channel, 30s interval |
| AI agent | Investigation tools + system prompt |
| Workflows | Alert → investigate → create case → remediate |
| Dashboards | Executive dashboard + OTel signal dashboards |
| SLOs | 21 SLOs auto-created across all services |
| Data views | `logs.otel`, `logs.otel.*`, `metrics-*` |

✅ **You're ready for the next challenge when** you can see logs, services, or SLOs in the Elastic Serverless tab.
